# OER Search Index Setup

The search index offers the possibility to search quickly in various oer sources.

With this project you can set up all components that are necessary to run the index. The process uses [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) to install the components.

Currently some parts of this project are based on the prototypes [oerhoernchen20](https://github.com/programmieraffe/oerhoernchen20) made by [Matthias Andrasch](https://twitter.com/m_andrasch) and [Docker-Hoernchen 2.0](https://github.com/sroertgen/oerhoernchen20_docker) made by [Steffen RÃ¶rtgen (im Rahmen des Projektes JOINTLY)](https://github.com/sroertgen).

## Concept

![Overview OERSI](doc/images/OER-Search-Index-Overview.png)

### Central Index

As a link between the individual OER repositories. The index harvests (e.g. daily) the repositories of the federal states, or generally data sources that provide metadata, such as the AV portal, SlideWiki etc.

### Local Index

The same index can also be reused at the level of a federal state (or generally distributed), assuming that no data storage is required, but only linking of content (e.g. from LMS or GitLab). Here the harvester can be used to read out e.g. the LMS of the universities or a state-wide GitLab instance. Alternatively, a user management system can be connected for this purpose, with which individual persons can insert, change or delete their own content.

### Components

* **Harvester**: The harvester connects to the individual repositories and fetches metadata updates according to a configured schedule (e.g. daily).
* **API / Backend**: Provides interfaces to retrieve data from the index (external) and to import / update data into the index (internal). A read-only user is used to retrieve data. When creating / updating the data, the data is first written into an SQL database and from there written into an elasticsearch index with the help of logstash.
* **Frontend**: Website that displays the data from the index and offers the possibility to search
* **User Management**: _Optional_ - only needed if the index is used as a (local) standalone solution. So users can be given access to manually update the data via a UI.

## Installation

* install ansible galaxy roles:
     * ```ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.elasticsearch,4.1.0``` 
     * ```ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.logstash,5.0.2``` 
* create config.yml (see config-example.yml)
* ```ansible-playbook -v -i config.yml ansible/system.yml```

## Run it locally 

Set up an oer-search-index in a virtual machine with minimal effort.

Prerequisites
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (tested with 2.17.1)
* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (tested with 2.0.2)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (tested with 5.2.34_Ubuntu)

Perform the following steps in the terminal (Linux / macOS) or in the GitBash (Windows).
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/oer/oersi-setup.git
cd oersi-setup
vagrant up
```
When the installation is complete (a few minutes, depending on the download speed), the index can be opened in the browser

<http://192.168.98.115/>

You can stop the virtual machine with
```
vagrant halt
```
... and start again with
```
vagrant up
```
If you want to reload the configuration (including the import from the oer sources), perform
```
vagrant reload --provision
```

## Technologies

- **Scrapy**: First OER repositories are crawled using [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) -> just for the first prototype; a general, robust approach has to be developed (see https://gitlab.com/oersi/oersi-metadata-harvester)
- **MariaDB**: Used to store the results of Scrapy.
- **Logstash**: Logstash is regulary checking the MariaDB database, if any new items are added or changes are made to existing entries.
- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch is the search engine and indexes the input it gets from Logstash.
- **Backend**: The backend is the interface for read/write access to the index, see https://gitlab.com/oersi/oersi-backend
- **Frontend**: The frontend is used from https://gitlab.com/oersi/oersi-frontend
